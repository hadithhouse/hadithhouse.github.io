  <p>HadithHouse is a project containing collections of Islamic Hadiths with an interactive GUI which allows users to search the collection, find the sources of hadiths and their authenticity, etc.</p>

  <p>I am developing this project during my free time which means the development is very slow. If I get enough donations from you, I will be able to leave my job and treat this project as my full time job. Please donate generously!</p>
